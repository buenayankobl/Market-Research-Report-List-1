<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy On Cardiovascular Disease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viral Gene Therapy</li><li>Non-Viral Gene Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy for cardiovascular disease involves the use of genes to treat or prevent heart conditions. It can be categorized into two main types: viral gene therapy and non-viral gene therapy. Viral gene therapy utilizes modified viruses to deliver therapeutic genes into target cells, leveraging the viruses' natural ability to infect cells. In contrast, non-viral gene therapy employs methods such as liposomes, nanoparticles, or electroporation to introduce genetic material without using viral vectors, often offering safer and more controlled delivery options.</p></p>
